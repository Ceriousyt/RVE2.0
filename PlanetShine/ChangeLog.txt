    * "PlanetshineCelestialBody" nodes are now affected by Module Manager

- fixed a bug that made the light always come from the center of the planet instead of the actual illuminated part of the surface

- added the option to change the maximum orbital range of the light reflection
- added the option to set the ratio of atmosphere ambient on ground for each planet/moon
- added the option to disable the area light technique in order to get better performance (by default it uses 3 lights to simulate an area, but if you disable it it will only use one light)
- on planets/moons without atmosphere, the reflective light is more spread around the ship when landed
- tweaked many settings to improve the light effects
