## Description

Distant Object Enhancement is a visual enhancement mod that makes objects realistically visible over large distances.

### BASIC FEATURES

* Flare effects for planets and nearby satellites, properly calculated by size, distances, phase angle, etc.
* Flare effects are coloured for each planet, which makes for easy identification.
* On-rails vessels up to 750km away are visually rendered (no intensive physics calculations necessary)
* Background stars dim when looking at the bright surface of a nearby planet, just like in real life!
* If you have blizzy78's Toolbar plugin, a settings window is available with several options to improve performance or tweak visuals.
* Full compatibility with custom planet mods -- with flare colour definitions included for Real Solar System, PlanetFactory, and Alternis Kerbol.
